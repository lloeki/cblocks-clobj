# C Blocks Closure-Objects

Fooling around with Blocks in C to create pseudo-classes and -instances.

## Usage

    make
    ./main

Optionnally:

    CC=clang make

But mainly, read the source.

## Requirements

A compiler that supports C blocks, like clang (whatever the plaform) or GCC with Apple's block patches.

## Wishes

I wish C11 had blocks as standard, and GCC get on board, and the FSF and Apple stop fighting over copyright assignment blocking an otherwise fine patch merge.
